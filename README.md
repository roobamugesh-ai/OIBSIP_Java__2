Number Guessing Game

🎯 Objective

The objective of the Number Guessing Game is to develop a simple Java-based application that generates a random number within a given range and allows the user to guess it. The program guides the user by indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the generated number until the correct guess is made.

⚙️ Steps Performed

The system generates a random number between 1 and 100.
The user is prompted to enter a guessed number.
The program compares the user’s guess with the generated number.
If the guess is incorrect, the program displays whether the number is higher or lower.
The process repeats until the user guesses the correct number or the maximum number of attempts is reached.
The total number of attempts is displayed at the end.

🛠️ Tools Used

Programming Language: Java
IDE: Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans
Libraries: java.util.Random, java.util.Scanner
Platform: Windows / Linux

✅ Outcome

Successfully developed a working Number Guessing Game in Java.
Improved understanding of loops, conditionals, random number generation, and user input.
The program provides an interactive and user-friendly experience.
This project serves as a beginner-friendly application demonstrating core Java concepts.
